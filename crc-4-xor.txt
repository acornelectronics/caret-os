CRC-4-XOR
Error Correction Code

Prerequisite:
In binary systems data is represented in 1s and 0s called Bits.
A sequence of bits is called a bit String.
A string of 4 bits is a Nibble.
A string of 8 bits is a Byte.

Encoding:
Each data byte is split into 2 4bit nibbles.
String together the most significant nibbles (MSN).
String together the least significant nibbles (LSN).
Note: This reduces the chances of both nibbles getting corrupted.
Result: [MSNs][LSNs]

On each data byte perform a Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) with a 4bit remainder
using the prime number 19 (0x13). String the remainder nibbles together.
Note: These nibbles will be used for error detection.
Result: [MSNs][LSNs][CRCs]

For each data byte perform an Exclusive OR (XOR) including the most significant nibble,
least significant nibble, and CRC remainder. String the product nibbles together.
Note: These nibbles will be used for error correction.
Result: [MSNs][LSNs][CRCs][XORs]
